Todo-list for the project 
=================================================
This is what needs to be done on the project with the feedback that it has gotten.

- Keep the information-button on the cards in the menu and make it more obvious that you can click the cards to flip them around.
	- Add the information icon that is found in the results-cards to the menu-cards
	- Make the front-side of the cards in the menu non-clickable and instead add a button to lower-left as seen on the back of the card that flips it around.

STATUS: NOT COMPLETED
---------------------

- Add more colors- and/or pictures to make everything more interesting.
	- Whatever works.

STATUS: NOT COMPLETED
---------------------

- Make fully-fletched home-page and about page, now everything is just one tab so it's kind of pointless having three different views when only one is really used.
	- Have a back-end where an ID is created for every new user that is stored in a cookie. This is used at the homepage if a user has saved any of their workouts so they're easily accessible. This solves the usability and minimal-backend. The id's could just be stored in a JSON-file. 

STATUS: NOT COMPLETED
---------------------

- Being able to store workouts.
	- As previous entry suggested. Having ID:s for every user stored in a cookie for recognition we can create a JSON-object for every id that contains lists for their workouts, one list being one workout, and in that list we just save the ID, sets and reps for every exercise.

STATUS: NOT COMPLETED
---------------------

- Make it so the workouts can be displayed in a more interactive way.
	- Think of it as a "media-player" so like a "workout-player" where you are taken to either a dialog pop-up or a completely different new, the "workout" mode so the user can follow their workout while being on the webpage.
