Interaction Programing - Project
=================================================
This is the workout planner, welcome!

Don't have instructions on how to set up, it's using firebase and here are links:
https://workoutplanner-50643.firebaseapp.com/
http://workout-planner-git.herokuapp.com/


Don't know if this works below

To set up:

1. Download the repository and extract anywhere you want.

2. Open the NodeJS cmd and cd to "projectTraining"

3. Now run the command "npm install" to install dependencies/bower_components

4. Now run the command "heroku local" to start a local server

5. Enjoy!
